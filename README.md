This is my work done throughout the Semester!

# 🚓 Chicago Data Graph

This is a graph of the crime in Chicago using data from it's Data Portal so all the information is true. I think this was an interesting assignment that I was always curious about, as much as Chicago is a beautiful place, it is filled with plenty of crime. It really wasn't as complicated as I thought it would've been because I just had to get the information from the Data Portal and yeah I live here so it's something I would wanna know more about.

# 🎮 Steam Player Count Chart

This is a Steam Player Count Data Visualization or Chart that displays data for Steam's most popular games and observing the the one that is being played the most. This was one of my Project Assignments making it really hard and to think about a concept for what I wanted to do for this project and i thought of what I love most: Video Games.

This was one of my assignments I had a lot of fun working on, as I always wanted understand morse code which I think I do more with this. I always wondered how a translating website worked and the coding behind this one was interesting but made it seem simple. So I appreciated working on making a morse code translator, pretty straightforward.

# ⛅ Climate Change Data Visualization

This is a Climate Change Data Visualization, which displays Life Style Inputs which basically means it calculates how many miles you driven and the electricity usage to determine how much output of CO2 is being released from what we've done, and its a interesting assignment and a fun html. It is very interactable with sliders to scroll and I had a good time making this one.
